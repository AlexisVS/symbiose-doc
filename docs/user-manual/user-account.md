# User Account & Personal data management





### Password update




* Log in via the login page using their current credentials
* Open an application (any)
* Open the right side panel, by clicking on the menu at the top right
* Select the last panel tab (settings)
* Under the name and email address of their user account, click on the "User settings" button
* In the form, replace the current password (encrypted) with the new desired password (in clear)
* In the form, click on the "Save" button (or "cancel" to abandon the change)
* During subsequent identifications, you must use the new password (the current session remains active)



!!! Note "User rights"
    Unless a user has Admin rights, a user can only change some properties in its profile : `password, firstname, lastname, language, locale`

!!! Note "Password reset"
    Only the encrypted value of the password is stored. So, if you forget it, nobody will be able to remind you of it. In such case, your only options are either to reset the password or ask your administrator to set another password for you.
